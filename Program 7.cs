//Question 3. CLR or common language runtime is what it is called before adding a constructor method.

//Question 4. We would be using the concept of overloading.

//Question 5. So that you can have the ability to create fault-tolerant programs that can resolve exceptions.

//Question 6. The purpose of private vs. public when adding new properties is to hide the details of their implementation 
//from the clients. Public can be used, seen, accessed by any method whereas private is only used when called and needed. 
//It applies to information hiding in the way of abstracting the data that clients need for functionality 

//Question 7. Composition is when classes can have the capability to have references to objects of other class members. 
//Otherwise known as “has-a” relationships.

//Question 8. Data abstraction is when a client case about what functionality a class offers and not about how that 
//functionality is implemented.
